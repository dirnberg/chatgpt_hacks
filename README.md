# qr_vcard_generator

is a Python script that generates a QR code for vCard information.

A vCard is an electronic business card that contains contact information such as name, company, position, phone numbers, and email address. The script takes a JSON string as input with vCard information and creates a QR code that can be scanned by a mobile device to read the vCard information.

Here's how the script works:

The script imports the necessary Python modules argparse, json, and qrcode. The qrcode module is used to generate the QR code, while argparse is used to parse command-line arguments.
The script creates an argparse object and defines a command-line argument called "--vcard" that takes a string value. The default value for this argument is a JSON string with empty fields for vCard information.
The script parses the command-line arguments using the argparse object and stores the vCard information in a dictionary called "vcard_data".
The script extracts the relevant fields from the vcard_data dictionary and concatenates them into a string that follows the vCard standard format.
The script creates a QR code object using the qrcode module, adds the vCard string as data to the QR code object, and sets the error correction level, box size, and border.
The script generates the QR code image using the make_image() method of the QR code object and saves it as a PNG file.
Overall, this script provides an easy way to generate a QR code for vCard information that can be shared with others through email, social media, or other means.
