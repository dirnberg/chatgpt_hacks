# vcard_qr_generator.py

is a Python script that generates a QR code for vCard information.

A vCard is an electronic business card that contains contact information such as name, company, position, phone numbers, and email address. The script takes a JSON string as input with vCard information and creates a QR code that can be scanned by a mobile device to read the vCard information.

Here's how the script works:

The script imports the necessary Python modules argparse, json, and qrcode. The qrcode module is used to generate the QR code, while argparse is used to parse command-line arguments.

The script creates an argparse object and defines a command-line argument called "--vcard" that takes a string value. The default value for this argument is a JSON string with empty fields for vCard information.

The script parses the command-line arguments using the argparse object and stores the vCard information in a dictionary called "vcard_data".

The script extracts the relevant fields from the vcard_data dictionary and concatenates them into a string that follows the vCard standard format.

The script creates a QR code object using the qrcode module, adds the vCard string as data to the QR code object, and sets the error correction level, box size, and border.

The script generates the QR code image using the make_image() method of the QR code object and saves it as a PNG file.
Overall, this script provides an easy way to generate a QR code for vCard information that can be shared with others through email, social media, or other means.

# vcard_qr_logo.py

This script generates a new image with a QR code overlaid with a logo image. The script takes an input image path for the QR code as a command-line argument using argparse.

The script loads the QR code image and the logo image using PIL library. Then it resizes the logo image to 300 dpi for better resolution and transparency. It then converts the logo image to RGBA mode for transparency purposes.

The script calculates the position to place the logo image in the center of the QR code image. Then it converts the QR code image to RGBA mode for transparency and overlays the logo image on top of the QR code image.

Finally, the script generates a new output PNG image with the overlaid logo and saves it with a new filename based on the input filename. The new image is saved with a DPI of 600x600.

To run the script, the user needs to provide the path to the input QR code image as a command-line argument using the --qr_path flag. If the --qr_path flag is not provided, the default filename vcard_qr.png will be used.

Prompt: Write a Python script that generates a QR code with a logo and saves it as a new PNG image. The script should take a command-line argument for the path to the input QR code image and default to 'vcard_qr.png'. The logo should be placed in the center of the QR code image, with transparency if necessary, and resized to 300 dpi. The output PNG image should have '_logo' appended to its name and be saved at a resolution of 600 dpi.
